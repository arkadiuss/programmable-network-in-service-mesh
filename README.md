# Applicability of programmable network devices in service mesh architectures

This repository contains work used in my master thesis: "Applicability of programmable network devices in service mesh architectures". A bunch of lab/architecture on which I test implementations. 

`src` contains labs on which concepts were tested

`hasicups-docker-images` contains reference architecture to test concepts

`*-machine` Vagrantfiles for machines used for testing
