This is a reference architecture on which I'm going to implement proposed service mesh concept. It leverages HashiCorp's demo-app because it is a great example of modern microservices application. Services are "randomly" distributed between hosts. One docker container simulates on node in a datacenter network. More info in the thesis.

To run the app:
```
docker-compose up
```
